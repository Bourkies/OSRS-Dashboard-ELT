# This file is used to seed the PB report with records achieved

# src/historical_personal_bests.toml
# This file defines the structure, filtering, and starting records for the Personal Bests page.

# --- Settings ---
# Defines the name for the group that catches any records not listed in the groups below.
other_group_name = "Miscellaneous PBs"
# Default sorting for the dashboard. Options: "config", "alphabetical"

# --- Personal Best Blacklist ---
# Use this to prevent certain users from holding records.
# Rules are applied *after* username remapping from the main config has been completed.
#
# To blacklist a user from a specific task under a certain time:
#   - username: The player's name.
#   - task_name: The exact name of the task.
#   - max_time: Any PB by the user for the task *under* this time will be ignored.
#   - { username = "PayedForCoxTime", task_name = "Chambers of Xeric (Team Size: Solo)", max_time = "16:22.60" },
#
# To blacklist a user from ALL personal bests entirely:
#   - username: The player's name. (Omit task_name and max_time).
#   - { username = "KnownCheater" }
#
blacklist = [

# --- Filtering Rules ---
# A record is excluded if its task name contains ALL strings within any single rule set.

    ["Tombs of Amascut", "Challenge"],
    ["Tombs of Amascut", "Entry mode"],

# --- Record Groups ---
# Groups will be displayed on the dashboard in the order they appear here.
# Records will be displayed in the order they appear if default_item_sort is "config".
