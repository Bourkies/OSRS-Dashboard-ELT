#
# To blacklist a user from a specific task under a certain time:
#   - username: The player's name.
#   - task_name: The exact name of the task.
#   - max_time: Any PB by the user for the task *under* this time will be ignored.
#   - { username = "PayedForCoxTime", task_name = "Chambers of Xeric (Team Size: Solo)", max_time = "16:22.60" },
#
# To blacklist a user from ALL personal bests entirely:
#   - username: The player's name. (Omit task_name and max_time).
#   - { username = "KnownCheater" }

# --- Filtering Rules ---
# A record is excluded if its task name contains ALL strings within any single rule set.
