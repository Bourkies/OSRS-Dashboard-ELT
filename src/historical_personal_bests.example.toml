# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# This file is used to define the structure and groups for the Personal Bests page.
# You can pre-seed it with historical records or leave the times as "0:00" to start fresh.

# src/historical_personal_bests.toml
# This file defines the structure, filtering, and starting records for the Personal Bests page.
#
# Each record can have the following fields:
# - name: The exact name of the task as it appears in the Discord message. (Required)
# - time: The historical time for the record. Use "0:00" for none. (Required)
# - holder: The historical holder(s) of the record. Can be a string or a list of strings. (Required)
# - discord_emoji: An optional Discord emoji to display next to the record name.
#   - For standard Unicode emojis, use the emoji itself (e.g., "ü•ã").
#   - For custom server emojis, you must use the full emoji code: "<:emoji_name:emoji_id>".
#     To get this, type \:emoji_name: in Discord and it will reveal the full code.

# --- Personal Best Blacklist ---
# Use this to prevent certain users from holding records.
# Rules are applied *after* username remapping from the main config has been completed.
#
# To blacklist a user from a specific task under a certain time:
#   - username: The player's name.
#   - task_name: The exact name of the task.
#   - max_time: Any PB by the user for the task *under* this time will be ignored.
#   - { username = "PayedForCoxTime", task_name = "Chambers of Xeric (Team Size: Solo)", max_time = "16:22.60" },
#
# To blacklist a user from ALL personal bests entirely:
#   - username: The player's name. (Omit task_name and max_time).
#   - { username = "KnownCheater" }

# --- Filtering Rules ---
# A record is excluded if its task name contains ALL strings within any single rule set.

# --- Record Groups ---
# Groups will be displayed on the dashboard in the order they appear here.
# Records will be displayed in the order they appear if default_item_sort is "config".
